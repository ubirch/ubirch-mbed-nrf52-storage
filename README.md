# Flash Storage

> **âš  WIP: not all tests are working yet!**

An mbed OS library to store data in non-volatile memory. Requires some
setup to ensure space is available or alternatively, you know your
free areas.

Wraps the chip and mbed specific implementations in an easy to use
library.

To add this library to your project:

```bash
mbed add https://github.com/ubirch/ubirch-mbed-nrf52-storage
```

## Nordic nRF52832

These functions allow the handling of the non-volatile data storage in
the flash memory of the MCU.

## Testing

```bash
mbed new .
# possibly fix mbed-os.lib!
mbed target NRF52_DK
mbed toolchain GCC_ARM
mbed test -n tests-storage-nrf52*
```
